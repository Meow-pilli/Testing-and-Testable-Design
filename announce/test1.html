    <!--
        <li> Most likely, we will go to a larger room for Test 1.
            Watch this site for the announcement. If nothing is
            announced, Test 1 will be in our regular classroom. 
    
       <li> <font color="#FF0000">
               Test 1 will be in ECSS 2.102 (TI Auditorium)
               in the first level of 
               <A HREF = "https://map.utdallas.edu/">
               the ECS South building</A>. 
            </font>
    -->
       <p>
       <li> Test 1 will be in <b> ECSS 2.312 (DIFFERENT from our regular classroom)</b>. The duration of the test will be approximately 1.5 hours 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm on Tues. Feb. 20, 2024.
       <p>
       <li> Please have your student ID with you.
       <p>
       <li> Test 1 is closed book and closed notes. Cheat (or formula) sheet is not allowed. No calculator is needed.
       <p>  
       <li>There will be no question on Synopsys CAD tool or HDL.
       <p>  
       <li> All issues discussed in the class (even those that are not in the
           text) will be considered for the test. You are not
           responsible for those topics that we have not discussed in the class
           (even those that are in the book or my notes).
           I suggest you first carefully study your own notes and course notes/slides.
           Then, study at least one of the recommended texts for 
           more descriptions and examples related
           to those topics that we covered. 
       <p>  
       <li>Important topics covered in notes:<br>
           Introduction (philosophy, terminology, importance, taxonomy, 
           fault models), Economics & Quality (basic definitions of
           yield, defect level, fault coverage), Fault Modeling
           (stuck-at-fault, fault equivalence/dominance, 
           boolean difference, general CNF modeling for test generation, 
           effect of redundancy, path sensitization, checkpoint theorem), 
           Test Generation for Combinational Circuit (test generation process, 
           using 5-, 6- and 9-valued logic, basis and application of 
           D-algorithm and PODEM to small examples), four methods of fault simulations (serial, parallel, deductive, concurrent,
           critical path tracing), testability metrics (SCOAP), general concept of fault sampling.
    
       <p>  
       <li>Useful and related parts of the recommended texts 
    (Chapters 1-5 in Jha/Gupta):<br>
           Please refer to your own and my class notes for details of
           the topics that are
           (or are not) covered. These are the important (not 
         the complete list of) topics in each chapter:
         <p>
           Chapter 1 (taxonomy, definition, without formulas/proofs), 
         <p>
           Chapter 2 (definitions and models), 
         <p>
           Chapter 3 (fault equivalence/dominance, parallel/deductive/concurrent fault simulations, critical path tracing),   
         <p>
           Chapter 4 (concept of CNF, concept of testability metrics, SCOAP metrics)
           path sensitization, 5/6/9 value logic, implication, 
           justification, D- and PODEM algorithms without details and pseudocodes).
