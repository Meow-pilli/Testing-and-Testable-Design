    <!--
        <li> Most likely, we will go to a larger room for Test 1.
            Watch this site for the announcement. If nothing is
            announced, Test 1 will be in our regular classroom. 
    
       <li> <font color="#FF0000">
               Test 1 will be in ECSS 2.102 (TI Auditorium)
               in the first level of 
               <A HREF = "https://map.utdallas.edu/">
               the ECS South building</A>. 
            </font>
    -->
       <p>
       <li> Test 1 will be in <b> ECSS 2.312 (DIFFERENT from our regular classroom)</b>. The duration of the test will be approximately 1.5 hours 1:00 pm - 2:30 pm on Thurs. March 28, 2024.
       <p>
       <li> Please have your student/Photo ID with you.
       <p>
       <li> Test 2 is closed book and closed notes.
            No calculator is needed.
       <p>  
       <li> All issues discussed in the class (even those that are not in the
           text) will be considered for the test. You are not
           responsible for those topics that we have not discussed in the class
           (even those that are in the book or my notes).
           I suggest you first carefully study your own notes and course notes/slides.
           Then, study at least one of the recommended texts for 
           more descriptions and examples related
           to those topics that we covered. 
    
          <p>  
      <li> There will be no direct question from the topics covered in Test 1.
           However, due to dependency of topics,
           the basic concepts of stuck-at-fault modeling, equivalent/dominant
           faults, checkpoint theorem and test pattern generation 
           method (e.g. generic D-algorithm) should be remembered.
         <p>  
         <li>Important topics covered in notes:<br>
          Test Generation for Sequential Circuit (time-frame expansion using 5- and 9-valued logic), 
          Delay Fault Testing (finding robust and non-robust test vectors in combinational circuits),
           Memory Test (basic concept, fault models, up to the beginning of march tests).
       <p>  
       <li>Useful and related parts of the recommended texts 
    (Chapters 5, 8, 14 in Jha/Gupta):<br>
           Please refer to your own and my class notes for details of
           the topics that are
           (or are not) covered. These are the important (not 
         the complete list of) topics in each chapter:
         <p>
          Chapter 5 (sequential circuit testing, time-frame expansion),
         <p>
           Chapter 8 (delay fault testing),
         <p>
           Chapter 14 (memory test; basic concept and models up to the beginning of march tests).
